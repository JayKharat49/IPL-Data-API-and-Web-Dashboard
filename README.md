# IPL Data API and Web Dashboard

## Description

The IPL Data API and Web Dashboard project is designed to provide comprehensive data analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset sourced from Kaggle. This project serves a dual purpose:

1. **Data Analysis and APIs:** The project performs an in-depth analysis of the IPL dataset and creates a variety of APIs for easy access to specific data points. These APIs cover aspects like bowling records, batting records, team records, and much more. Users can leverage these APIs to fetch IPL-related information conveniently.

2. **Web Dashboard:** In addition to the APIs, a user-friendly web dashboard is developed. This dashboard offers users a comprehensive platform to access and interact with IPL data. It provides an intuitive interface for exploring and visualizing various IPL statistics.

## Features

- In-depth data analysis of IPL dataset.
- Creation of APIs for accessing specific IPL data points (e.g., bowling records, batting records, team records).
- User-friendly web dashboard for easy IPL data exploration and visualization.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data analysis and API development.
- Flask for creating APIs.
- Web development frameworks or libraries for the web dashboard (HTML/CSS- Basic).
- Kaggle dataset as the source of IPL data.

## Future Improvements

As part of ongoing development, the project aims to create a dedicated application based on the IPL data. This application will further enhance the user experience by offering tailored features and functionalities, making it even more valuable for IPL enthusiasts and data analysts.

By combining data analysis, APIs, a web dashboard, and future application development, this project seeks to provide a holistic IPL data solution that caters to a wide range of user needs.
